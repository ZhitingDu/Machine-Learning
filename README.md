🔺Objective:
Predict the Pass/Fail result
Evaluation whether all the features are contributed to build the model or not 
Showing the usage of several data manipulation methods.

🔺 Dataset description:
The feature dataset consists of 1567 examples each with 590 features.
The lable dataset contains the binary target column, “ –1” corresponds to a pass with 1463 cases and “1” corresponds to a fail with 104 cases.

🔺 Key functions:
sklearn, imblearn, PCA, Boruta, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
